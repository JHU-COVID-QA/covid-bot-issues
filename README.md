# covid-bot-issues

This site is for reporting issues that are found with the covid-bot. To use, you will first need to create an account here on github. To report a bug/problem/issue with the chatbot simply:

*  Click on the tab issues
*  In the upper right, click on the green button "new issue"
*  In the title field, name what the problem is. For instance "Bot cannot answer 'Can I run?'"
*  In the textbox below, describe what happens.
   -  Say what you typed in. "Can I run?"
   -  Say what was the response. "I'm not quite sure how to answer your question."
   -  Say what was expected. "Expected answer should include information about exercising."
*  Optional: You can drag and drop images into the box. For instance, a screenshot of the problem.
*  Optional: On the right, there is the option to add a label. Here, I've labeled it "exercising_issues". This just helps us organize the problems.
*  Click on the green button "Submit new issue"

And that's all! Then you can keep adding more. Thanks for the help on this. You can see the example issue here: https://github.com/JHU-COVID-QA/covid-bot-issues/issues/1
